# _Bucketlistly Landing Page Replica_

#### Week 1 Project - CSS

#### By **Rose Sponseller and Daniela Trulls, Monday May 22, 2017**

## Description

This website is a replica of Bucketlistly.com landing page. The site uses the `float` property or page layout. Font Awesome was used for the icons and the `transform` property was used to rotate the flag.

This project was completed during my time at Epicodus, during week one of CSS class.
